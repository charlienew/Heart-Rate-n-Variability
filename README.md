Abstract
We propose a novel representation of beat-to-beat variation in electrocardiography, called heart rate n-variability (HRnV), as an alternative to conventional heart rate variability (HRV). The derivation of HRnV parameters are based on multiple RR intervals with or without overlaps. We are able to create many sets of HRnV parameters which are promising at generating extra information from limited data source. We also present three approaches on the use of HRnV, and discuss further on potential applications and future directions. We believe that HRnV is an important addition to HRV, and will contribute to extending the landscape of current studies on HRV.
